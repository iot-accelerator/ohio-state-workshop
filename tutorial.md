# Tutorial

## Plunker

We are going to be using a REPL (read-evaluate-print-loop) tool called Plunker for this workshop. Plunker is great because it helps us run code in a known environment and under known conditions. This helps get around the issue of different different versions of tools, OSes and compilers and helps us get started quicker.
